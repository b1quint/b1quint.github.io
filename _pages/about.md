My name is Bruno Corrêa Quint. I am 32 years old and my main activities are
related to Astronomical Instrumentation, Software for Astronomy, Photography,
Martial Arts (Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu) and Origami. I am natural from
Florianópolis - SC, Brazil, but I have been in Chile since the second half of
2015.

I finished my undergrad in Physics in 2007 at
[Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina](http://ufsc.br/) and I did my
Masters and my PhD at [Universidade de São Paulo](http://www5.usp.br/).

I started training Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu in January, 2008 and I just received
the 4th Dan from Dai Shihan Nestor Iscovi.

I have been studying photography since 2012 and the
[Digital Photography School](digital-photography-school.com/) has been my main
resource. Of course, my knowledge in Physics, Optics and Astronomy helps me to
understand the technical concepts in this field. But photography, in the end, is
an art. I like to use it to share my world with those who are far away. I love
Natural Photography, Astro-Photography and Urban Photography.
