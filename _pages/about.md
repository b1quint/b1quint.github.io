Hi. My name is Bruno Corrêa Quint. I am 32 years old and my main activities are
related to Astronomical Instrumentation, Software for Astronomy, Photography,
Martial Arts (Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu) and Origami. I am natural from
Florianópolis - SC, Brazil, but I have been in Chile since the second half of
2015.
